In response to the pressing issue of cyberbullying, I engineered a groundbreaking Conversational AI agent with vocal capabilities. This innovative solution aims to provide vital emotional support to individuals grappling with cyberbullying experiences. Utilizing a robust tech stack including Python, React, OpenAI API, Amazon Web Services, and Eleven Labs API, this project exemplifies the power of technology to address and mitigate the harmful effects of online harassment.
